triggers:
  - POST from igris_logic post-push fix
  - CI/CD failure detection
  - Manual error trigger
output:
  description: Self-healing pipeline with Cursor integration and auto-push
  details:
    - igris_logic detects post-push errors
    - Triggers Cursor patch generation via audit_migrate
    - Applies patches and auto-commits/pushes
    - Re-validates service health
    - Stores successful fixes as Runes for Whis learning
core_endpoints:
  - POST /post-push/fix (igris_logic)
  - POST /patch (audit_migrate)
  - POST /validate/scaffold (igris_logic)
flow:
  1: audit_migrate scaffolds and pushes
  2: CI fails or deploy fails
  3: igris_logic POST /post-push/fix { service_path }
  4: Diagnoses error, sends fix prompt
  5: audit_migrate POST /patch with Cursor prompt
  6: Patch applied, git commit + push
  7: igris re-validates
  8: whis stores Rune if successful
requirements:
  - Error detection in scaffolded services
  - Cursor integration for patch generation
  - Git auto-commit and push capabilities
  - Service re-validation
  - Whis learning integration
linked_agents:
  - igris_logic (error detection)
